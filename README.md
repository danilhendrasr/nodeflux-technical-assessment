<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
In order to participate in Nodeflux's internship program as a software engineer, 
applicants were required to complete a technical assessment. We were tasked to build a 
containerized COVID-19 API using either C++, Rust, or Python.
This project is made to complete the said technical assessment. 

This API is only a mask API, the data source is https://data.covid19.go.id/public/api/update.json,
it is a COVID-19 API seemingly provided by the Indonesian government,
but the design is not quite good because it only provides 1 endpoint and 
the only respond it provides is in a daily format containing all daily cases 
since the begining of COVID-19.

This API provides a more friendly interface, users can get the data in daily, monthly, 
and yearly format as well as search for specific date, month, and/or year.

The following is the diagram:

    Client->>This API: request monthly cases
    This API->>Data Source: send get request
    Data Source->>This API: send JSON response
    This API->>This API: convert response to monthly format
    This API->>Client: send monthly cases
```

### Why Rust? ðŸ¤”
Initially the reason for choosing Rust was because I presume it's 
more impressive in the recruiter's eyes if I built it using Rust 
and so that I can treat it as my Rust learning playground as well.

But looking back, I think one more reason I can add to that is
Rust is fast in doing CPU-heavy operations, which is what this API
does on a regular basis (converting quite large amount
of data into another form). On the other hand, Python is not as fast 
in doing such operations and C++ is too hard for a beginner
like to get productive quickly,
thus in my opinion Rust is the ideal choice for this one.

### No caching? ðŸ˜•
Not at the moment.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Running the API
#### Using Docker
1. Pull the image from GitHub Container Registry:
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/danilhendrasr/rust-covid-api:latest
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name rust-covid-api -p 8082:8082 danilhendrasr/rust-covid-api
   ```
3. Access the API via [localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082).

#### Building From Source
##### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.57 (used to write this program)
- pkg-config (for linux system)
- libssl-dev (for linux system)

##### Steps
1. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```
2. Access the API via [localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082).

### Running Tests
Run the following command:
```bash
cargo test
```
> **Note**<br>
> Some tests might fail when being run in a certain situation.
>
> For example, the test for yearly endpoints might fail if it's being run on the first day
> of a new year because the code uses the current date and time to determine
> the latest date and time, while the source API might haven't updated its data.
> This should be fixed once the caching mechanism is in place though.

### API Documentation
Go to [localhost:8082/docs/](http://localhost:8082/docs/) for documentation.
