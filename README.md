<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
In order to participate in Nodeflux's internship program as a software engineer, 
applicants were required to complete a technical assessment. We were tasked to build a 
containerized COVID-19 API using either C++, Rust, or Python.
This project is made to complete the said technical assessment. 

This API is only a mask API, the data source is https://data.covid19.go.id/public/api/update.json,
it is a COVID-19 API seemingly provided by the Indonesian government,
but the design is not quite good because it only provides 1 endpoint and 
the only respond it provides is in a daily format containing all daily cases 
since the begining of COVID-19.

This API provides a more friendly interface, users can get the data in daily, monthly, 
and yearly format as well as search for specific date, month, and/or year.

The following is the diagram:

    This API->>Data Source: send get request
    Data Source->>This API: send JSON response
    This API->>This API: convert response to monthly format
    This API->>Client: send monthly cases
```

### Why Rust? ðŸ¤”
Initially the reason for choosing Rust was because I presume it's 
more impressive in the recruiter's eyes if I built it using Rust 
and so that I can treat it as my Rust learning playground as well.

But looking back, I think one more reason I can add to that is
Rust is fast in doing CPU-heavy operations, which is what this API
does on a regular basis (converting quite large amount
of data into another form). On the other hand, Python is not as fast 
in doing such operations and C++ is too hard for a beginner
like to get productive quickly,
thus in my opinion Rust is the ideal choice for this one.

### No caching? ðŸ˜•
Not at the moment.

### Tests?
There are some tests in place already but it's incomplete, 
I'm planning to complete it soon, see roadmap. 

### API Contract ðŸ“—

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Using Docker
The docker image is available to pull from in the following url: [https://hub.docker.com/r/danilhendrasr/rust-covid-api](https://hub.docker.com/r/danilhendrasr/rust-covid-api).
#### Steps
```bash
# Pull the image from docker hub
docker pull danilhendrasr/rust-covid-api

# Run the container, will be accessible through localhost:8081
docker run -d --name rust-covid-api -p 8081:8081 danilhendrasr/rust-covid-api
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Build from source
#### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.57 (used to write this program)
- pkg-config (for linux system)
- libssl-dev (for linux system)

#### Steps
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/danilhendrasr/nodeflux-technical-assessment rust-covid-api

# change the current directory
cd rust-covid-api

# build program and dependencies
cargo build --release

# run the program, the app will be accessible through localhost:8081
cargo run --release
```
